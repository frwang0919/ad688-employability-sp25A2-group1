    "text": "Recent research has highlighted a growing divergence in salary trends between artificial intelligence (AI)-focused careers and more traditional data science roles. Zhu ((2024)) found that professionals specializing in AI-related fields, such as machine learning engineers and AI researchers, consistently command higher salaries than their non-AI counterparts, including data analysts and general data scientists. This difference in compensation reflects the increasing demand for AI expertise as industries integrate automation, deep learning, and predictive analytics into their operations. While AI roles require specialized skills in areas such as neural networks and natural language processing, traditional data science positions often focus more on business intelligence, statistical analysis, and data visualization, which though even that is valuable it does not see the same salary premiums.\nOther studies reinforce this trend, showing how company size and industry specialization further impact salary structures. Chen, Song, and Lam ((2024)) analyzed U.S. salary trends from 2020 to 2023, reporting that salaries in AI-driven roles have shown steady increases, particularly within mid-to-large tech companies investing in AI innovation. In contrast, non-AI data science roles, such as data analysts, have experienced slower growth, and some projections indicate potential stagnation or slight salary declines in 2024. Similarly, Quan and Raheem ((2023)) found that professionals with expertise in AI, cloud computing, and big data technologies earn higher salaries than those with more generalist skills. Their findings suggest that as AI adoption expands across industries, the wage gap between AI and non-AI roles may continue to grow, emphasizing the importance of specialized technical expertise for long-term career advancement in data science."
