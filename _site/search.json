Many of the companies with the most postings—Deloitte, Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Oracle, Infosys, Meta, and CDW—are major players in technology, consulting, and digital transformation, sectors that have been heavily investing in AI, machine learning, and data-driven innovation.\nThe dominance of these companies in job postings suggests that careers in AI and technology-related fields are in high demand. Consulting giants like Deloitte, Accenture, PwC, and KPMG are actively expanding their AI divisions, helping businesses integrate AI into their operations. For instance, Deloitte has launched several AI tools, including chatbots like “DARTbot” for audit professionals and “NavigAite” for document review, to enhance efficiency and client services (Stokes, 2025). Additionally, companies like Meta are pioneers in AI research, focusing on areas such as generative AI, automation, and data science. Even in non-tech sectors, financial and healthcare firms such as Citigroup, Cardinal Health, and Blue Cross Blue Shield are leveraging AI for fraud detection, risk assessment, and personalized healthcare.\nThese trends indicate that pursuing a career in AI-related fields, such as data science, machine learning engineering, and AI research, could provide greater job opportunities and higher earning potential. The strong presence of technology and consulting firms in job postings reflects how AI is becoming a fundamental part of business strategies across industries. While traditional, non-AI careers will continue to exist, the rapid push toward automation and intelligent systems suggests that AI-related skills will be increasingly valuable in both technical and non-technical roles. As industries continue adopting AI, professionals who develop expertise in this area may have a competitive advantage in the evolving job market."

Most industries exhibit salary concentrations below $200K, with some sectors showing significantly higher outliers above $300K-$500K, suggesting high-paying roles in specialized fields.\nAI-related jobs, typically found in industries such as technology, finance, and advanced manufacturing, often contribute to these high-salary outliers. Roles in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence engineering command premium salaries due to their specialized skill requirements, talent scarcity, and high demand across multiple industries. The broader salary spread in AI-intensive fields may also reflect differences in job seniority, from entry-level analysts to highly compensated AI researchers and executives.\nAdditionally, AI-driven industries tend to offer competitive compensation to attract top talent, given the rapid pace of technological advancement and the strategic importance of AI in business growth. The dense clustering of lower salaries in non-AI industries indicates a more constrained range, potentially due to standardized pay structures or lower technical barriers to entry."

These occupations rely heavily on AI, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making, making it clear that mastering AI-related skills is directly linked to higher salaries. The strong earnings for these roles indicate that industries are willing to pay a premium for professionals who can build, interpret, and optimize AI-driven systems.\nIn contrast, traditional non-AI careers, which are not as data or automation-focused, tend to fall outside these top salary brackets. The job market is shifting towards AI dependency, where knowing how to work with artificial intelligence, big data, and automation tools is no longer just an advantage but a necessity for higher-paying opportunities. As industries integrate AI at an increasing pace, professionals who fail to develop AI-related expertise risk stagnating in lower-paying roles, while those who embrace AI technologies position themselves for significantly better financial rewards."

    "text": "As the economy adapts to AI technologies, many industries are experiencing shifts in job structures and salary scales. This topic is important because job seekers need to be aware of the changing landscape to make career decisions that align with future trends and personal goals. These years, the rise of AI and automation is creating new job roles while displacing others. Moreover, remote work, which played an important role during the pandemic, has become a permanent feature for many industries. However, questions remain about how compensation for remote roles compares to in-office positions and how it varies across regions and industries. Based on typical trends on the job market, this analysis will explore several key findings:\n\nHow do salaries differ across AI vs. non-AI careers?\nWhat regions offer the highest-paying jobs in AI-related and traditional careers?\nAre remote jobs better paying than in-office roles?\nWhat industries saw the biggest wage growth in 2024?"

Our goal was to find natural patterns in how job roles are distributed across different experience and salary ranges. After clustering, we used NAICS6_NAME industry classifications to interpret the types of industries represented in each cluster.\nBy doing so, we can better understand how different industries vary in their experience requirements and compensation levels, providing insights into salary structures across the job market.\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"LightcastData\").getOrCreate()\n\n# Load Data\ndf = spark.read.option(\"header\", \"true\").option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\").option(\"multiLine\",\"true\").option(\"escape\", \"\\\"\").csv(\"lightcast_job_postings.csv\")\n\n# Show Schema and Sample Data\n# df.printSchema() \n# df.show(5)\n\n# Register the DataFrame as a temporary SQL table\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"job_postings\")\n\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

Offers only moderate salary levels despite higher experience.\nTop Industries: Computer Systems Design Services, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and Custom Computer Programming Services.\nInsight: Jobs demanding significant prior experience but offering relatively moderate compensation. Indicates competitive markets in tech and consulting sectors.\n\nCluster 2:\n\nExperience/Salary Pattern: Consistently the highest salaries across a wide range of experience levels.\nTop Industries: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, Web Search Portals and Other Information Services, and Commercial Banking.\nInsight: Reflects premium-paying roles in consulting, web services, and finance. This suggests opportunities for substantial earnings even with moderate experience.\n\nCluster 3:\n\nExperience/Salary Pattern: Requires lower years of experience. Salary levels are generally the lowest.\nTop Industries: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, Employment Placement Agencies, and Direct Health and Medical Insurance Carriers.\nInsight: Entry-level or early-career roles in sectors with limited immediate salary growth.\n\nCluster 4:\n\nExperience/Salary Pattern: Moderate years of experience required. Salary levels are moderately high.\nTop Industries: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, Employment Placement Agencies, and Commercial Banking.\nInsight: Steady career tracks offering good compensation for mid-experience professionals.\n\n\nImplications for Salary and Compensation Trends: - Salary growth is not always linear with experience; certain clusters show salary plateaus despite increasing experience. - Industry effects are significant: sectors like Professional Services and Finance consistently appear across clusters, but compensation levels vary depending on experience requirements. - High-paying opportunities exist both at low and high experience levels, depending on industry and role specialization.\nImplications for Job Seekers: - High Salary Aspirations: Target roles in Cluster 2 industries like consulting, finance, and web services where premium salaries are achievable even with moderate experience.\n\nCareer Launch: Cluster 3 industries may provide easier entry points for new graduates but with lower starting salaries. In contrast, positions in Cluster 4 offer a good balance between experience investment and salary rewards.\nBeware of High-Experience/Moderate-Pay Sectors: Cluster 1 jobs may require significant experience without corresponding salary premiums, requiring careful career planning.\n\n\n\n2 Supervised Learning: Random Forest Regression\nTo deepen our analysis on Salary and Compensation Trends, we constructed a Random Forest Regression model using salary as the target variable. The goal of this model is to predict salary outcomes based on key job posting attributes, and to identify the relative importance of different factors influencing compensation in the labor market.\nThe predictor variables selected for the model include: DURATION, MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE, LOT_V6_OCCUPATION_NAME, STATE_NAME, EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME\n\ndf_rf = df.dropna(subset=['DURATION', 'MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE',  \n                          'LOT_V6_OCCUPATION_NAME', 'STATE_NAME', 'EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME',\n                          'SALARY'])\n\ncategorical_cols = ['LOT_V6_OCCUPATION_NAME', 'STATE_NAME', 'EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME'] \ncontinuous_cols = ['DURATION', 'MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE'] \n\n# Index and One-Hot Encode\nindexers = [StringIndexer(inputCol=col, outputCol=f\"{col}_idx\", handleInvalid='skip') for col in categorical_cols]\nencoders = [OneHotEncoder(inputCol=f\"{col}_idx\", outputCol=f\"{col}_vec\") for col in categorical_cols]\n\n# Assemble base features \nassembler = VectorAssembler(\n    inputCols=continuous_cols \n    + [f\"{col}_vec\" for col in categorical_cols], \n    outputCol=\"features\"\n)\n\n# Build pipeline and transform\npipeline = Pipeline(stages=indexers + encoders + [assembler]) \ndata = pipeline.fit(df_rf).transform(df_rf)\n\n# Show final structure\ndata.select(\"SALARY\", \"features\").show(5, truncate=False)\n\n[Stage 443:&gt;

In our model, years of experience are by far the strongest predictor of salary. Having some certain occupation titles can also greatly affect salary expectations. Interestingly, the job posting duration is also an important factor in salary prediction, which may be related to stable roles. - On the other hand, geographic location and job type have less impact on salary predictions, with states like Oregon and California showing specific salary patterns.\nImplications for Job Seekers: - Experience Pays Off: The model shows that minimum years of experience is the dominant factor influencing salary. For job seekers, gaining and accurately showcasing professional experience is crucial to achieving higher salary outcomes. Moreover, investing in data-related skills can be a smart career move. - Occupation Choice Matters: Specific technical roles (especially Computer Systems Engineers, Data Analysts, and Business Intelligence Analysts) are associated with higher salaries. Choosing high-demand, specialized roles can significantly improve salary prospects. - Location Strategy: While experience and occupation dominate, geography still plays a role, for example, states like Oregon, California, and New York affect salary expectations. Job seekers willing to relocate or negotiate for remote work with companies based in higher-paying states may gain salary advantages."

Many of the companies with the most postings—Deloitte, Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Oracle, Infosys, Meta, and CDW—are major players in technology, consulting, and digital transformation, sectors that have been heavily investing in AI, machine learning, and data-driven innovation.\nThe dominance of these companies in job postings suggests that careers in AI and technology-related fields are in high demand. Consulting giants like Deloitte, Accenture, PwC, and KPMG are actively expanding their AI divisions, helping businesses integrate AI into their operations. For instance, Deloitte has launched several AI tools, including chatbots like “DARTbot” for audit professionals and “NavigAite” for document review, to enhance efficiency and client services (Stokes, 2025). Additionally, companies like Meta are pioneers in AI research, focusing on areas such as generative AI, automation, and data science. Even in non-tech sectors, financial and healthcare firms such as Citigroup, Cardinal Health, and Blue Cross Blue Shield are leveraging AI for fraud detection, risk assessment, and personalized healthcare.\nThese trends indicate that pursuing a career in AI-related fields, such as data science, machine learning engineering, and AI research, could provide greater job opportunities and higher earning potential. The strong presence of technology and consulting firms in job postings reflects how AI is becoming a fundamental part of business strategies across industries. While traditional, non-AI careers will continue to exist, the rapid push toward automation and intelligent systems suggests that AI-related skills will be increasingly valuable in both technical and non-technical roles. As industries continue adopting AI, professionals who develop expertise in this area may have a competitive advantage in the evolving job market."

The top-paying role, “Computer Systems Engineer / Architect,” averages over $156,000, followed by “Business Intelligence Analyst” at $125,000 and other AI-driven roles like “Data Mining Analyst” and “Market Research Analyst,” all exceeding $100,000. These occupations rely heavily on AI, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making, making it clear that mastering AI-related skills is directly linked to higher salaries. The strong earnings for these roles indicate that industries are willing to pay a premium for professionals who can build, interpret, and optimize AI-driven systems.\nIn contrast, traditional non-AI careers, which are not as data or automation-focused, tend to fall outside these top salary brackets. The job market is shifting towards AI dependency, where knowing how to work with artificial intelligence, big data, and automation tools is no longer just an advantage but a necessity for higher-paying opportunities. As industries integrate AI at an increasing pace, professionals who fail to develop AI-related expertise risk stagnating in lower-paying roles, while those who embrace AI technologies position themselves for significantly better financial rewards."

A few meaningful patterns emerge:\n\nComputer Systems Engineer / Architect consistently ranks as the highest-paid occupation, maintaining an average salary around or above $150,000. This reflects the strong demand for highly skilled professionals in systems architecture, a field that supports infrastructure in both legacy enterprises and cloud-native environments.\nData / Data Mining Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts both show stable and competitive salaries in the range of ~$120,000–$130,000. These roles are closely tied to data-driven decision-making, reflecting how AI and analytics continue to shape business strategy and operations.\nClinical Analysts / Clinical Documentation Specialists demonstrate slightly lower salary levels but remain relatively consistent, indicating steady demand in the healthcare and life sciences sectors—often associated with electronic health records, compliance, and process optimization.\nBusiness / Management Analysts show moderate but stable pay, aligning with generalist consulting and strategic support functions. While their salaries are slightly below the technical roles, they still remain above the $100,000 mark.\n\nOverall, this plot reinforces the idea that technical and analytical occupations—especially those connected to data, engineering, and system-level design—continue to command premium salaries in the job market. Notably, salary stability across all five roles suggests that these are high-value, high-demand positions, resilient to short-term economic shifts."

This could reflect specialized part-time positions (e.g., consultants or contract professionals) that still command high hourly rates despite reduced hours.\n\nNotably, the relatively narrow gap between employment types suggests that skills and job function may have a stronger influence on salary than hours alone. High-paying part-time and hybrid roles could indicate a shift toward flexible, high-skill labor markets, where experienced professionals negotiate premium pay for reduced workloads."

    "text": "Recent research has highlighted a growing divergence in salary trends between artificial intelligence (AI)-focused careers and more traditional data science roles. Zhu ((2024)) found that professionals specializing in AI-related fields, such as machine learning engineers and AI researchers, consistently command higher salaries than their non-AI counterparts, including data analysts and general data scientists. This difference in compensation reflects the increasing demand for AI expertise as industries integrate automation, deep learning, and predictive analytics into their operations. While AI roles require specialized skills in areas such as neural networks and natural language processing, traditional data science positions often focus more on business intelligence, statistical analysis, and data visualization, which though even that is valuable it does not see the same salary premiums.\nOther studies reinforce this trend, showing how company size and industry specialization further impact salary structures. Chen, Song, and Lam ((2024)) analyzed U.S. salary trends from 2020 to 2023, reporting that salaries in AI-driven roles have shown steady increases, particularly within mid-to-large tech companies investing in AI innovation. In contrast, non-AI data science roles, such as data analysts, have experienced slower growth, and some projections indicate potential stagnation or slight salary declines in 2024. Similarly, Quan and Raheem ((2023)) found that professionals with expertise in AI, cloud computing, and big data technologies earn higher salaries than those with more generalist skills. Their findings suggest that as AI adoption expands across industries, the wage gap between AI and non-AI roles may continue to grow, emphasizing the importance of specialized technical expertise for long-term career advancement in data science."

We focused on the industry group Computing Infrastructure Providers, Data Processing, Web Hosting, and Related Services, as it closely aligns with our chosen career path.\nThe bar plot below illustrates the top 10 skills most in demand within IT job postings, providing insights into industry expectations.\n\nit_jobs = job_postings[job_postings['NAICS_2022_6'] == 518210]\n\n\nall_skills = []\n\ndef parse_skills(skills_str):\n    try:\n        if pd.isna(skills_str):\n            return []\n        try:\n            return json.loads(skills_str)\n        except:\n            return ast.literal_eval(skills_str)\n    except:\n        print(f\"Warning: Could not parse skills: {skills_str}\")\n        return []\n\nfor skills_str in it_jobs['SKILLS_NAME'].dropna():\n    skills_list = parse_skills(skills_str)\n    all_skills.extend(skills_list)\n\nskill_counter = Counter(all_skills)\ntop_10_skills = skill_counter.most_common(10)\n\ntop_skills_df = pd.DataFrame(top_10_skills, columns = ['Skill', 'Count'])\n\n\ntotal_postings = len(it_jobs)\ntop_skills_df['Percentage'] = (top_skills_df['Count'] / total_postings * 100).round(1)\ntop_skills_df = top_skills_df.sort_values('Count', ascending = False)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(\n    x = 'Count', \n    y = 'Skill', \n    data = top_skills_df,\n    hue = 'Skill',\n    palette = \"Blues_r\"\n)\nplt.title(\"Top 10 Skills Required in IT Job Postings\", fontsize = 16)\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Job Postings\", fontsize = 12)\nplt.ylabel(\"Skills\", fontsize = 12)\nplt.xlim(0, 500) \n\nfor i, row in enumerate(top_skills_df.itertuples()):\n    plt.text(\n        row.Count + 5, \n        i, \n        f\"{row.Count} ({row.Percentage}%)\",\n        va='center'\n    )\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Team Skills Improvement Plan\nThe bar plot of the top 10 most in-demand skills from IT job postings underscores the significance of core technical skills such as Computer Science (35.8%), Data Analysis (32.4%), SQL (30.2%), and Python (24.9%). These skills highlight the industry’s emphasis on data-driven decision-making and coding expertise as fundamental requirements.\nWhen compared to our team’s current skill set, it is evident that we should prioritize developing knowledge in Data Science and SQL, which are highly demanded by the industry. Furthermore, while our team assessment did not initially account for Communication, the plot shows it as the most sought-after skill in IT job postings. This serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and effective interpersonal interactions in IT careers. Technical expertise alone is insufficient; the ability to articulate ideas and communicate solutions is critical.\nThe data also reveals that employers value a combination of technical proficiency, soft skills, and operational knowledge. To address skill gaps within our team, we can adopt a collaborative approach:\n\nKnowledge-sharing and mentorship: Team members skilled in communication can guide others in developing interpersonal abilities, while those with expertise in Python or SQL can lead technical workshops.\n\nSpecialization by strengths: Individuals strong in communication can take on tasks such as presentations and stakeholder engagement, whereas those skilled in technology can focus on back-end technical work.\n\nThis strategy not only bridges skill gaps but also optimizes team collaboration, positioning us as more competitive in the IT job market."
