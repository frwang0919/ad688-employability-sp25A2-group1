        "**Model Evaluation:**\n",
        "- The R-Squared of 0.454 indicates a moderate level of predictive power, suggesting that the model captures a substantial portion of salary variability but leaves room for improvement. \n",
        "- The scatterplot shows that most predictions are reasonably aligned with the actual salaries but tend to underpredict higher salary values (especially above $200,000), which is common due to the small number of very high salaries (\"long tail\" effect).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feature Importance Analysis:**\n",
        "- The top 15 feature importances from random forest model show how different factors contribute to salary predictions. In our model, years of experience are by far the strongest predictor of salary. Having some certain occupation titles can also greatly affect salary expectations. Interestingly, the job posting duration is also an important factor in salary prediction, which may be related to stable roles. \n",

        "\n",
        "**Implications for Job Seekers:**\n",
        "- **Experience Pays Off:** The model shows that minimum years of experience is the dominant factor influencing salary. For job seekers, gaining and accurately showcasing professional experience is crucial to achieving higher salary outcomes. Moreover, investing in data-related skills can be a smart career move.\n",
        "- **Occupation Choice Matters:** Specific technical roles (especially Computer Systems Engineers, Data Analysts, and Business Intelligence Analysts) are associated with higher salaries. Choosing high-demand, specialized roles can significantly improve salary prospects.\n",
        "- **Location Strategy:** While experience and occupation dominate, geography still plays a role, for example, states like Oregon, California, and New York affect salary expectations. Job seekers willing to relocate or negotiate for remote work with companies based in higher-paying states may gain salary advantages.\n"
