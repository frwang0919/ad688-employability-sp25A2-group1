# Topic: Salary & Compensation Trends  
## Introduction
The global job market is undergoing a significant transformation due to various factors, 
including the rapid adoption of **artificial intelligence (AI)**, evolving work models 
such as **remote work**, and shifts in **industry-specific** wage structures. For job seekers, 
understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions about career paths, 
salary expectations, and work environment preferences. This research aims to **analyze 
salary trends for AI and non-AI careers, as well as the impact of remote work, regional 
differences, and specific industry on salaries**.

## Research Rationale
As the economy adapts to AI technologies, many industries are experiencing shifts in job 
structures and salary scales. This topic is important because **job seekers need to be aware 
of the changing landscape to make career decisions that align with future trends and personal goals**. 
These years, the rise of AI and automation is creating new job roles while displacing others. 
Moreover, remote work, which played an important role during the pandemic, has become a permanent 
feature for many industries. However, questions remain about how compensation for remote roles compares 
to in-office positions and how it varies across regions and industries. Based on typical trends on the 
job market, this analysis will explore several **key findings**:

- How do salaries differ across AI vs. non-AI careers?
- What regions offer the highest-paying jobs in AI-related and traditional careers?
- Are remote jobs better paying than in-office roles?
- What industries saw the biggest wage growth in 2024?
