```

The visualization of the top 20 companies by job postings (excluding "Unclassified") highlights key trends in the job market, particularly in the increasing demand for AI-related roles. Many of the companies with the most postings—Deloitte, Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Oracle, Infosys, Meta, and CDW—are major players in technology, consulting, and digital transformation, sectors that have been heavily investing in AI, machine learning, and data-driven innovation.

The dominance of these companies in job postings suggests that careers in AI and technology-related fields are in high demand. Consulting giants like Deloitte, Accenture, PwC, and KPMG are actively expanding their AI divisions, helping businesses integrate AI into their operations. For instance, Deloitte has launched several AI tools, including chatbots like "DARTbot" for audit professionals and "NavigAite" for document review, to enhance efficiency and client services (Stokes, 2025). Additionally, companies like Meta are pioneers in AI research, focusing on areas such as generative AI, automation, and data science. Even in non-tech sectors, financial and healthcare firms such as Citigroup, Cardinal Health, and Blue Cross Blue Shield are leveraging AI for fraud detection, risk assessment, and personalized healthcare.

These trends indicate that pursuing a career in AI-related fields, such as data science, machine learning engineering, and AI research, could provide greater job opportunities and higher earning potential. The strong presence of technology and consulting firms in job postings reflects how AI is becoming a fundamental part of business strategies across industries. While traditional, non-AI careers will continue to exist, the rapid push toward automation and intelligent systems suggests that AI-related skills will be increasingly valuable in both technical and non-technical roles. As industries continue adopting AI, professionals who develop expertise in this area may have a competitive advantage in the evolving job market.

## Salary Distribution by Industry

```{python}
fig = px.box(job_postings, x="NAICS_2022_6_NAME", y="SALARY", title="Salary Distribution by Industry")
fig.update_layout(width=1200, height=1000)
fig.update_layout(**plotly_layout)
fig.show()
```

The box plot provides a clearer view of salary distributions across industries, highlighting variations in median salaries and outliers. Most industries exhibit salary concentrations below \$200K, with some sectors showing significantly higher outliers above \$300K-\$500K, suggesting high-paying roles in specialized fields.

AI-related jobs, typically found in industries such as technology, finance, and advanced manufacturing, often contribute to these high-salary outliers. Roles in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence engineering command premium salaries due to their specialized skill requirements, talent scarcity, and high demand across multiple industries. The broader salary spread in AI-intensive fields may also reflect differences in job seniority, from entry-level analysts to highly compensated AI researchers and executives.

Additionally, AI-driven industries tend to offer competitive compensation to attract top talent, given the rapid pace of technological advancement and the strategic importance of AI in business growth. The dense clustering of lower salaries in non-AI industries indicates a more constrained range, potentially due to standardized pay structures or lower technical barriers to entry. 

## Top 5 Occupations by Average Salary

```{python}
avg_salary_per_occupation = job_postings.groupby("LOT_V6_OCCUPATION_NAME")["SALARY"].mean().reset_index()

top_occupations = avg_salary_per_occupation.sort_values(by="SALARY", ascending=False).head(5)

fig = px.bar(
        top_occupations,
        x="SALARY",
        y="LOT_V6_OCCUPATION_NAME",
        orientation='h',
        title="Top 5 Occupations by Average Salary",
        labels={"SALARY": "Average Salary ($)", "LOT_V6_OCCUPATION_NAME": "Occupation"},
        text=top_occupations["SALARY"]
    )

fig.update_layout(
        xaxis_title="Average Salary ($)",
        yaxis_title="Occupation",
        yaxis={"categoryorder": "total ascending"}, 
        height=700,
        width=900
    )

fig.update_layout(**plotly_layout)
fig.show()
```

The salary distribution in the graph clearly shows that the highest-paying occupations are directly tied to artificial intelligence, data analytics, and business intelligence. The top-paying role, "Computer Systems Engineer / Architect," averages over \$156,000, followed by "Business Intelligence Analyst" at \$125,000 and other AI-driven roles like "Data Mining Analyst" and "Market Research Analyst," all exceeding \$100,000. These occupations rely heavily on AI, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making, making it clear that mastering AI-related skills is directly linked to higher salaries. The strong earnings for these roles indicate that industries are willing to pay a premium for professionals who can build, interpret, and optimize AI-driven systems.

In contrast, traditional non-AI careers, which are not as data or automation-focused, tend to fall outside these top salary brackets. The job market is shifting towards AI dependency, where knowing how to work with artificial intelligence, big data, and automation tools is no longer just an advantage but a necessity for higher-paying opportunities. As industries integrate AI at an increasing pace, professionals who fail to develop AI-related expertise risk stagnating in lower-paying roles, while those who embrace AI technologies position themselves for significantly better financial rewards.

## Average Salary by Employment Type

```{python}
avg_salary_by_type = (
    job_postings.groupby("EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME")["SALARY"]
    .mean()
    .sort_values(ascending=False)
    .reset_index()
)

import plotly.express as px

fig = px.bar(avg_salary_by_type, 
             x="EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME", 
             y="SALARY",
             title="Average Salary by Employment Type",
             labels={"SALARY": "Average Salary ($)", "EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_NAME": "Employment Type"},
             text="SALARY")

fig.update_layout(yaxis_tickprefix="$", height=500)
fig.update_layout(**plotly_layout)
fig.show()
```

This bar chart compares the average salaries across different employment types, revealing key patterns in compensation based on job structure:

- Full-time roles (>32 hours) lead with the highest average salary at approximately $117,324, which aligns with expectations — these positions often come with more responsibilities, benefits, and long-term career opportunities.

- Part-time / full-time hybrid roles earn slightly less on average (~$104,379), potentially due to inconsistent hours or project-based employment models that offer flexibility but not always the highest compensation.

- Part-time roles (≤32 hours) average just below $102,000, a surprisingly competitive figure. This could reflect specialized part-time positions (e.g., consultants or contract professionals) that still command high hourly rates despite reduced hours.

Notably, the relatively narrow gap between employment types suggests that skills and job function may have a stronger influence on salary than hours alone. High-paying part-time and hybrid roles could indicate a shift toward flexible, high-skill labor markets, where experienced professionals negotiate premium pay for reduced workloads.
