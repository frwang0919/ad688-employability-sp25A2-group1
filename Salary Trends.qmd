Recent studies have highlighted the evolving salary trends in the data science 
field, demonstrating how compensation varies based on job title, experience level, 
and employer characteristics. Zhu (2024) found that senior roles such as data 
scientists and machine learning engineers continue to command the highest salaries, 
particularly in larger organizations that prioritize data-driven decision-making. 
However, not all data science positions have experienced salary growth at the same rate. 
While engineering and AI-related roles have seen increases in compensation, generalist 
roles such as data analysts have shown stagnation or slight declines. These findings 
suggest a growing emphasis on specialized technical expertise, as companies place a 
higher value on advanced skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Other research supports this trend, reinforcing the importance of company size and 
experience level as key determinants of salary. Chen, Song, and Lam (2024) analyzed 
U.S. salary trends from 2020 to 2023, noting that mid-to-large companies consistently 
offer higher salaries than smaller firms, reflecting their ability to compete for top 
talent. Their study also projected continued salary growth for engineers and scientists, 
while data architects are expected to recover from previous declines, and analysts may 
face a reduction in compensation in 2024. Similarly, Quan and Raheem (2023) emphasized 
the role of specialized skill sets in shaping salary structures, demonstrating that 
professionals with expertise in AI, cloud computing, and big data technologies tend to 
secure higher-paying positions. These studies collectively highlight the shifting priorities 
in data science employment, where market demand increasingly favors roles that require advanced 
technical skills and domain specialization.
